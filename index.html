<p>StreamFlowâ„¢ is a stream processing tool designed to help build and monitor processing 
workflows.  The ultimate goal of StreamFlow is to make working with stream processing frameworks 
such as Apache Storm easier, faster, and with "enterprise" like management functionality.<br>
StreamFlow also provides a mechanism for non-developers such as data scientists, analysts, or 
operational users to rapidly build scalable data flows and analytics.</p>

<p>StreamFlow provides the following capabilites: </p>

<ol>
<li>A <strong>responsive web interface</strong> for building and monitoring Storm topologies.</li>
<li>An interactive <strong>drag and drop topology builder</strong> for authoring new topologies</li>
<li>A <strong>dashboard</strong> for monitoring the status and performance of topologies as well as viewing aggregated topology logs.</li>
<li>A speciaized <strong>topology engine</strong> which solves some Storm complexities such as ClassLoader isolation and serialization and provides a mechanism for dependency injection.</li>
<li>A <strong>modular framework</strong> for publishing and organizing new capabilities in the form of Spouts and Bolts.</li>
</ol>

<h2>
<a id="how-it-works" class="anchor" href="#how-it-works" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How it works</h2>

<p>The following is a simple depiction of the StreamFlow stack. The web interface is built using open 
source web frameworks and is backed by a series of reusable web services. StreamFlow is capable of 
authoring and managing topologies dynamically using a series of reusable Frameworks.  These 
Frameworks are simply JAR files comprised of standard Storm Spouts and Bolts with a metadata 
configuration file which exposes the frameworks.  StreamFlow utilizes a custom topology driver 
which is used to bootstrap and execute a topology along with StreamFlow specific configuration logic.</p>

<h2>
<a id="concepts" class="anchor" href="#concepts" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Concepts</h2>

<p>The following is a description of some core StreamFlow concepts and terminology.</p>

<h5>
<a id="component" class="anchor" href="#component" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Component</h5>

<p>A component is either Storm Spout or a Storm Bolt</p>

<h5>
<a id="framework" class="anchor" href="#framework" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Framework</h5>

<p>A grouping of related <em>Components</em> and their associated metadata. Ideally elements of a framework 
should all be compatible when wired together on a topology as they share the same protocol. 
Frameworks might be organized around a set of technologies or domains. An analogy would be a 
Java Library or Objective C Framework. Topologies have frameworks as dependencies.</p>

<h5>
<a id="resource" class="anchor" href="#resource" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Resource</h5>

<p>A resource is an object used by spouts/bolts in order to externalize common state. For example, an 
object which represents a technical asset in the environment/cluster such as a database or Kafka 
queue. Alternatively, a resource might provide an uploaded file or container of global state. 
Resources should be used to encapsulate functionality outside of a bolt/spout if that information 
is used in several places in a topology or within multiple topologies. Resources also provide a 
useful mechanism for injecting parameters, connections, or state into a bolt/spout making the spout 
or bolt simpler, easier to write, and more testable.</p>
